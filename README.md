# AUTO-COMPOUND

An auto-compound repository is a software project that enables validators to automatically accumulate rewards. Validators are individuals or entities that contribute computing power to maintain the security and integrity of a blockchain network. In return for their service, validators receive rewards in the form of cryptocurrency.

An auto-compound repository provides a convenient and efficient way for validators to maximize their earnings in a DeFi network. By automating the process of reinvesting rewards, validators can achieve exponential growth in their cryptocurrency holdings, while minimizing the amount of time and effort required to manage their investments.
